## _connecting us all one ride at a time_

**PyBer** is a fictional ride sharing app serving these city types:
  * urban
  * suburban
  * rural
  
  I visualized data for Pyber using Python language via Jupyter Notebook, and the libraries Pandas and Matplotlib. Two datasets were read in from CSV files and merged together into a dataframe. Then categories were grouped using groupby, and several key metrics were found using sum, mean, and count. Matplotlib was then extensively used to create meaningful visuals to show the relevant information for PyBer to get an overview of how thier rideshare program was being used accross the three city types they serve. I reviewed the findings and provided my reccomendations for how the company could look to expand into under utalized regions. Here are those findings:

  # New Opportunities for Market Direction
 

- Urban: The average Urban fare for PyBer is \$24.49, with a  max/min ride price of \$28.99 and \$20.09 respectively.  The urban city type has many drivers, however some are giving fewer rides than others. To increase profits, with out saturating the market with more drivers, Pyber can incentivize drivers with bonuses for reaching minimum ride counts.

***
- Suburban:  The average Suburban fare for PyBer is \$30.73, with a max/min ride price of \$36.42 and \$24.70 respectively. The suburban city type is worth exploring because there is room for increased ride count, while taking advantage of the 20% increased ride profit compared to urban city type. Because of the equal distribution of fares and driver count the suburban market is a safe place to explore new opportunities in order to increase profits.

***

- Rural: The average Rural fare for PyBer is \$34.64, with a max/min ride price of \$24.12 and \$43.28 respectively. There is a wide range of fare prices in the rural city type. With the average being greater than both urban and suburban. The higher fare average could be because of riders either starting at a destination in the rural area and driving into to town, perhaps to an airport or other frequently used destination. Before we can expand the rural city type profits, further information is required. Areas to consider are the origin and termination locations of the rides, driver availability, and the technology constraints such as cell phone use and coverage.
